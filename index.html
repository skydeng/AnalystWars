		<p>Our goal is to develop a product that helps investors navigate trades with better accuracy and use a social consensus to interpret future stock prices that compare against Wall Street Analysts. “Analyst Wars could be cool if you were able to group all the analysts offering coverage on a stock and compare their findings.” Says potential customer and trader Matt Uhrin, a CPA and Graduate student at Michigan State University studying Finance. We plan to cover only successful companies with outstanding financial balance sheets and diverage away from speculative stocks that so many traders like to make quick profits in. True investors buy into strong companies that have undervalued prices like Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham. Our mission is to use that philosophy to predict future stock prices in companies with strong fundamentals.
